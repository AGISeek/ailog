## Features

### ü§ñ **Advanced AI Detection**
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Automatically detects AI-generated code using advanced algorithms
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies AI-generated code patterns, syntax completeness, and boilerplate structures
- **Time Proximity Detection**: Correlates code changes with AI command execution timing
- **Manual Override**: Simple status bar toggle for manual AI attribution when needed

### üìä **Comprehensive Dashboard**
- **Rich Analytics**: Detailed metrics on AI-generated commits and code volume
- **Interactive Charts**: Visual trends showing your productivity over time
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by repository, branch, or time period
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data synchronization with your commit history

### üèóÔ∏è **Modern Architecture**
- **SOLID Principles**: Clean, maintainable code following industry best practices
- **Service-Oriented Design**: Modular services for detection, git operations, and UI management
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between components for better testability
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Full JSDoc documentation for all classes and methods

### üåç **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Internationalization**: Full support for English and Chinese (‰∏≠Êñá)
- **Theme-Aware UI**: Automatic adaptation to VS Code themes
- **Offline Capability**: All dependencies bundled for offline operation
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Interactive workflow for commit attribution decisions

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Seamless Integration**
- **Automatic Git Hooks**: Installs pre-commit and post-commit hooks automatically
- **VS Code Integration**: Deep integration with VS Code's UI and workflow
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Database Storage**: Local SQLite database for fast, reliable data storage

## How It Works

AIlog uses a sophisticated multi-layered approach to detect and track AI-generated code:

1. **Real-time Detection**: Monitors your code changes and applies AI detection algorithms
2. **Git Hook Integration**: Automatically captures commit metadata through Git hooks
3. **Data Analysis**: Processes commit data using multiple analysis dimensions
4. **Dashboard Visualization**: Presents insights through an interactive web-based dashboard

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Open a Git repository in VS Code
3. The extension will prompt you to install Git hooks - click **"Install Hook"**
4. Start coding and let AIlog track your AI-assisted development!

## Usage

### Basic Workflow
1. **Automatic Detection**: AIlog automatically detects AI-generated code changes
2. **Manual Override**: Click the status bar toggle (`AI Generated: ‚ùå/‚úÖ`) to manually mark commits
3. **Interactive Confirmation**: Before commits, choose whether to attribute them to AI
4. **Dashboard Analysis**: View your AI coding patterns in the comprehensive dashboard

### Commands
- `AIlog: Show Dashboard` - Opens the analytics dashboard
- `AIlog: Install Git Hook` - Installs Git hooks for automatic tracking
- `AIlog: Toggle AI Generated` - Manually toggle AI attribution for next commit
- `AIlog: Interactive Commit Check` - Interactive pre-commit AI attribution dialog

## Architecture Overview

AIlog follows SOLID principles with a clean, modular architecture:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/           # Command handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ managers/           # Core coordination logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           # Business logic services
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ detection/      # AI detection algorithms
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git/           # Git operations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/            # User interface services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/             # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/               # Utility libraries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database.ts        # SQLite database operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ i18n.ts           # Internationalization
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.ts       # Main extension entry point
```

### Key Components

#### AI Detection System
- **Pattern Analyzer**: Identifies AI-generated code patterns
- **Syntax Analyzer**: Checks for complete, well-formed code structures
- **Comment Analyzer**: Evaluates comment quality and style
- **Boilerplate Analyzer**: Detects common code templates
- **Time Proximity Analyzer**: Correlates timing with AI tool usage

#### Service Layer
- **Git Services**: Handle repository operations and commit processing
- **UI Services**: Manage status bar, notifications, and dashboard
- **Detection Services**: Coordinate AI detection algorithms

#### Management Layer
- **Extension Manager**: Coordinates all services and manages lifecycle
- **Command Manager**: Handles VS Code command registration and execution
- **Document Change Manager**: Monitors and processes file changes

## Configuration

AIlog works out of the box with sensible defaults, but you can customize:

- **Detection Sensitivity**: Adjust AI detection thresholds
- **Language Support**: Enable/disable detection for specific languages
- **Dashboard Preferences**: Customize chart types and data visualization
- **Internationalization**: Switch between English and Chinese interfaces

## Data Storage

- **Local Database**: `~/.watch-cursor/commits.db` (SQLite)
- **Privacy-First**: All data stays on your machine
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized database schema for fast queries
- **Backup-Friendly**: Standard SQLite format for easy backup/restore

## Development

AIlog is built with modern development practices:
